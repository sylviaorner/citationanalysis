# citationanalysis
This code was created for a citation analysis project using data on University of Scranton faculty publications and citations gathered from OpenAlex. The main goals of the project were to identify any patterns in faculty publishing practices and to identify overlap between works being cited by faculty research and current library subscriptions.
